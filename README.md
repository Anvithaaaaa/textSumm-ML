# textSumm - Meachine Learning 
**Text summarization** is the process of using software to abbreviate a written document in order to provide a summary of the main points of the original material or document.The length, writing style, and grammar are all factors that are taken into account by technologies that can provide a cohesive summary.

Extraction and Abstraction are the two main methods used in automated summarization. 
1. *Extractive Summarization*: This technique involves taking little pieces of text, including phrases and sentences, and stacking them together to form a summary. As a result, choosing the appropriate phrases to summarise is crucial when using an extractive technique.
2. *Abstractive Summarization*: These approaches create a brand-new summary using sophisticated NLP algorithms. This summary may contain details that aren't even there in the original text. A summary like that may use creative language. 

The majority of research to date has been on extractive techniques, which are suitable for video and picture collection summarization.
